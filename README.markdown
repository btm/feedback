Seth Vargo feedback!
====================

Saw this on [@holman's](https://github.com/holman) profile. I liked it. I stole it. Well, I didn't really "steal" it. I stole the idea. I think. I'm not really sure. Move along now.

Have a question for me? Want to complain about something I did/said? [File an issue on this project](https://github.com/sethvargo/feedback/issues/new) and I'll get back to you ASAP. And by ASAP I mean that I check my github more than my Facebook, so you can expect a pretty rapid response.

Before you Ask
--------------
Looked at the [closed issues (aka questions)](https://github.com/sethvargo/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) and see if it's been asked before. If it has, feel free to ask again, but I'll probably give you a Smart Ass response.

You Closed my Issue!... Dick
---------------------------
I have OCD. I can't stand to have open issues on projects. It's drives me insane if the number next to issues > 0. For that reason, you can also rest assured that I *will* respond in a timely manner

I have a Programming Question
-----------------------------
Ask. I may or may not be able to answer it, but I'll tell you either way. You can also ask stuff on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), where I am also fairly active.

You're a Smart Ass
------------------
Yep. I know.
